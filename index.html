                <h3>BUDAPEST WELCOMES HEAT WAVE WITH
                UNEXPLAINED EXPLOSION IN SKY</h3>

                <p>Residents of Budapest were startled when, a few minutes past midnight on Thursday, June 20th, a loud explosion was heard above the city. Witnesses claim to have heard it loudest near the Danube River by the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, and though the loud booming was enough for some to feel shaking, there were no reports of fire or damage to buildings. No injuries were reported. Party officials have confirmed that no traces of radioactive material were present.</p>
                <p>The news comes only a month after a statement from the Soviet Union declaring its boycott of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles ...</p>

                <p>The City</p>

                <p>I don’t really know how the name came to me. I only know that one night, I woke from my sleep and the city was there, clear and ready.</p>

                <p>Budapest.</p>

                <p>I didn’t have the slightest idea of what I would do or find there. But on I went, away from the sprawled heaviness of Los Angeles and towards the golden paprika city.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>I loved my rented flat. After my morning walks, I would lay down on the blue wooden tiles that were zigzagged throughout the living room, my eyes straying towards the high ceilings bathed in sunlight. The tiles made a soothing clicking sound, like walking on a million pieces of chalk.</p>

                <p>At night, I’d make sure both front doors were locked and place a chair in front of the innermost door, just in case. The owner of the flat had a collection of Ella Fitzgerald CDs that I’d play while eating dinner on the cerulean floor, scouting my map for the next day’s activities. At 11:30, I would climb the short set of stairs to get to the loft bed and fall into a deep sleep.</p>
