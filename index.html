                <h3>BUDAPEST WELCOMES HEAT WAVE WITH
                UNEXPLAINED EXPLOSION IN SKY</h3>

                <p>Residents of Budapest were startled when, a few minutes past midnight on Thursday, June 20th, a loud explosion was heard above the city. Witnesses claim to have heard it loudest near the Danube River by the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, and though the loud booming was enough for some to feel shaking, there were no reports of fire or damage to buildings. No injuries were reported. Party officials have confirmed that no traces of radioactive material were present.</p>
                <p>The news comes only a month after a statement from the Soviet Union declaring its boycott of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles ...</p>

                <p>- 2017 -</p>

                <p>I don’t really know how the name came to me. I only know that one night, I woke from my sleep and the city was there, clear and ready.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Budapest.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>I didn’t have the slightest idea of what I would do or find there. But on I went, away from the sprawled heaviness of Los Angeles and towards the golden paprika city.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>I loved my rented flat. After my morning walks, I would lay down on the blue wooden tiles that were zigzagged throughout the living room, my eyes straying towards the high ceilings bathed in sunlight. The tiles made a soothing clicking sound, like walking on a million pieces of chalk.</p>

                <p>At night, I’d make sure both front doors were locked and place a chair in front of the innermost door, just in case. The owner of the flat had a collection of Ella Fitzgerald CDs that I’d play while eating dinner on the cerulean floor, scouting my map for the next day’s activities. At 11:30, I would climb the short set of stairs to get to the loft bed and fall into a deep sleep.</p>

        <section class="fade story-block">
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>The restaurant I’d read about was off the Astoria Station, heading west. It had a strong reputation among the public and critics, and had new reviews on Yelp almost every day. The specialty: gourmet burgers, offering a tastier alternative to the intrusive McDonalds and Burger King locations that were peppered across the city.</p>
 
                <p>I had trouble  finding it the first time — it was a completely unassuming building. Besides not having any noticeable signage, its faded green outer walls blended with the soft greys and pastels of the avenue. I’d walked past it a few times before I noticed an empty tray with a few uneaten french fries on one of the tables inside. The door was open to let the air in, and on it in small black letters read “Astoria Burgers of Budapest.”</p>

                <p>Its interior was just as plain, with bland, peeling rose walls and wiry tables and chairs, likely relics from the Soviet era. I walked in with hesitation that first time, thinking I’d come to the wrong location.</p>

                <p>It was the height of the lunch hour, but there was no one eating inside, and no one at the register or in the kitchen. Hungry and unfazed, I picked up one of the simple white paper menus from the stack next to the register. There were two sides to the menu—one in Hungarian, the other in English—and two options: hamburger or cheeseburger. Both came with freshly made fries and a small Coke, whether you wanted them or not. And that was all.</p>

                <p>After about a minute of turning the menu over in my hands to see if that really was all there was, a young man emerged from a door at the far end of the kitchen. He was slightly tall with long arms, a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. He said nothing and only took out a small notepad and pencil from the front pocket of his apron, giving me a blank look.</p>

                <p>“Afternoon,” I blurted, a bit startled. “I’ll have the cheeseburger, please, with no pickles.”</p>

                <p>“I don’t use pickles,” was all he said, scribbling my order and heading back to the kitchen, where he began taking ingredients out of the refrigerator.</p>

                <p>Without the chance to thank him for taking my order, I stayed standing and admired the only piece of decoration on the walls: a malfunctioning clock whose hands were stuck at 12:33, its minute hand teetering back and forth between 12:33 and 12:34. There was nothing much else to observe, so I took out my phone to check for messages but saw that Astoria Burgers conveniently offered no WiFi.</p>

                <p>I moved to stand in front of the counter. He was leaning against the cabinets across from his grill, a spatula in his right hand and his cigarette on the left.</p>

                <p>“Are you the owner?”</p>

                <p>“Mhm,” he grunted, which I took as definitive.</p>

                <p>“I see. Did I beat the lunch rush?”</p>

                <p>“No,” he retorted, not taking his eyes off a sizzling patty on his grill.</p>

                <p>“Oh.” I decided to opt out of the small talk and took a seat instead, seeing that I didn’t need to compete for sitting space. After a few quiet minutes, a plate and glass clattered in front of me.</p>

                <p>“Enjoy,” the cook said, not all too enthusiastically, and headed back to the kitchen.</p>

                <p>A soft breeze blew in through the open door, and the Coke next to me fizzed cheerfully. I inspected the burger in front of me, hungry and pleased to see chunks of melted cheese stuck to the wrapping.</p>

                <p>In time, I’d come to know what I looked for in a burger, and to say Astoria’s burger was precise to the ounce, if not almost personalized, would be understatement. In my first bite I found everything—a bun covered in sesame seeds, plenty of melted cheese, and a lean patty no more than a centimeter in thickness.</p>

                <p>Of life’s pleasures, one that never underperforms is a side of fresh fries sprinkled with salt. In the case of Astoria, these were tastefully condimented with paprika, a staple of Hungary and later an aroma I would never forget.</p>

                <p>It was all gone in no more than ten minutes, the plate empty and the fizzy coke gulped. The soft breeze continued to flow through.</p>

                <p>When I stood to go to the register and pay, I found the cook sitting at the table directly across from the one I had been in, hands clasped under his chin, looking out through the open door.</p>

                <p>“This was delicious, thank you,” I said after softly clearing my throat to get his attention.</p>

                <p>After a few seconds, he turned to give me the smallest of smiles and got up to take my payment at the register. No credit cards, of course, so I pulled out two thousand Forints with a few more for tip, thanking him again and bidding him farewell.</p>

                <p>When I looked back before heading out the door, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>

        <section class="fade story-block">
            <div>

                <p>I returned to Astoria Burgers the following afternoon after a midmorning walking tour around the city. This time the cook was actually at the counter, drying off a stack of plates.</p>

                <p>He peered at me curiously, and I had the sense that he wasn’t all too surprised to see me. “Back for another?”</p>

                <p>I nodded. “I like burgers.”</p>

                <p>“Alright then. Same as yesterday?”</p>

                <p>“Yes, please.” I took a seat at the same table while he walked behind the counter towards the grill, lighting a cigarette on his way.</p>

                <p>“Is the restaurant a family business?” I asked.</p>

                <p>He gave a small laugh. “No.”</p>

                <p>I waited for a few seconds to see if he would follow up. There was a curious itch in my subconscious, an itch for a conversation and for one with answers. I decided to disregard my manners and be nosy, and possibly a bit rude.</p>

                <p>“So you bought the place recently?”</p>

                <p>“I’ve had it for a few years.”</p>

                <p>“I see. Is it just you?”</p>

                <p>“If you’re with Department of Health, I already had an inspection last month.”</p>

                <p>“No, I’m sorry,” I chuckled nervously. “I was just curious. But I will say that if this were Los Angeles, you’d be shut down for smoking on the job.”
                
                <p>He smirked, letting out a cloud of smoke. “Good thing this isn’t LA, then.”</p>

                <p>“Can’t say I disagree.”</p>

                <p>A plate appeared before me after a short while, and instead of disappearing into his kitchen, he slouched against the register counter, puffing away and watching the passersby.</p>

                <p>“What news do you have of Los Angeles?”</p>

                <p>A bit surprised by his initiative to chat, I gaped at him for a second before swallowing the mouthful I’d taken and wiped the corners of my mouth with a napkin.</p>

                <p>“Nothing much. The traffic gets worse and the rents keep going up.” Pause. “Some days I feel it brings out the worst in me.”</p>

                <p>He nodded as if he were mulling this over. “Fair enough. I take it you’re glad to be away for a while.”</p>

                <p>“I am. It has its faults, but sometimes I have to remind myself it’s not that bad. At least it’s not in a war zone. And if I shit-talk Trump I won’t be thrown in jail, or anything. But sometimes it takes me more than two hours to get home from work and I just want to burn the whole city to the ground. Let it start over.”</p>

                <p>I paused, flustered at being so open with a stranger, and attempted to bring back a helping of politeness to the conversation. “You should visit someday if you have the chance. You might like it.”</p>

                <p>“I don’t think you quite believe that,” he quipped, flicking his lighter on and off.</p>

                <p>I grinned at his comment. “Are you from Budapest?”</p>

                <p>“No.”</p>

                <p>I had the feeling that asking about his hometown wouldn’t be a good idea, so I held back. He must have sensed my hesitation, because he shared just a sliver more.</p>

                <p>“I’m from out of town. But you can say I’ve been here pretty much my whole life.”</p>

                <p>“I see. Do you like it here?”</p>

                <p>“Can’t say I don’t.”</p>

                <p>To be expected. He didn’t ask, but I continued. “I’m loving it so far. I could walk for miles here and not get tired.”</p>

                <p>This time he gave the second smallest of smiles. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”</p>

                <p>“Is there anything you recommend I check out?”</p>

                <p>He observed me for a few seconds, brows furrowed in thought. After a while, he said “Nothing in particular,” and disappeared into the kitchen.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>In the afternoon I explored the Parliament building, drowned in the softness of the evening light. By the time I returned to my blue-tiled flat, I’d walked a little over twelve miles. I was tired but not yet done for the day.</p>

                <p>In no mood for cooking, I headed back to Astoria Burgers for dinner. He was sitting outside on an empty crate, elbows on his knees, lighting a fresh cigarette.</p>

                <p>“There are other places to try, you know.” The smell of his tobacco felt enticing.</p>

                <p>“Not tonight,” I shrugged.</p>

                <p>This time, he ate along with me. I sat at my usual table and he stood at the counter, picking at a baked potato.</p>

                <p>Feeling unusually chatty, I told him about my adventure the previous day at an isolated bus stop in the outskirts of the city, surrounded by nothing but pasture and old Soviet statues.</p>

                <p>“What do you like most about Budapest?” I asked, sipping on iced water with lemon.</p>

                <p>He raised an eyebrow. “What do I like?”</p>

                <p>“Mhm. What would you miss if you had to move somewhere else?”</p>

                <p>“What would I miss.” He suddenly looked like he was far away.</p>

                <p>“Well, I like my restaurant. I like it a lot. And I like going to the baths.” He brought his fork a few inches from his eyes and stared at it intensely for a few seconds. “I like that I can walk anywhere I need to go. The trolleys are usually on time, and the trains are clean for the most part.”</p>

                <p>These were simple things, but I found myself wanting them more than anything. A seedling of envy towards my new friend started making its way up my spine as I pondered about his life, waking every day to an old city full of treasures and secrets and trains that actually ran on time.</p>

                <p>“What’s the weirdest thing you’ve seen here?”</p>

                <p>“Weird how?”</p> 
                
                <p>“Anything, like a glowing man or a UFO. My tour guide earlier today said she remembers a weird explosion from back when she was a kid in the ‘80s, but no one ever figured out what it was.”</p>

                <p>I saw him fully smile for the first time since I’d started coming to his restaurant.</p> 
                    
                <p>“Sometimes I meet Americans who eat nothing but burgers for lunch and dinner. Does that count?”</p>

                <p>We laughed, and moved on to a conversation about the many merits of boiled leeks.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>After dinner, my feet carried me through my nightly walk along the Danube, gold surrounding me left and right.</p>

                <p>My evening had been unexpectedly delightful. I felt refreshed, as if I’d met an old friend in an old city I knew well, and I resisted an urge to stifle a smile as I thought back on my conversations at the restaurant.</p>

                <p>One thing, however, lingered in the foreground of my thoughts. During the two hours I’d spent at Astoria, no one else came in. No local patrons, no delivery workers. I couldn’t be certain of Hungarian prime mealtime hours, but it still seemed strange for no one to come by, unless it was all just a heavy coincidence.</p>

                <p>And yet somehow, Astoria Burgers managed to have at least two new Yelp reviews each day since I’d been in Budapest. The photos showed the same simple menu I found that first day, and the same faded pink walls behind smiling reviewers. There was no mistaking it was the same place.</p>

                <p>I decided not to worry about it. After all, the emptiness of the restaurant had introduced me to a new somewhat-friend. The food was great and I was on vacation, and vacations were no time for critical thinking.</p>

                <p>A teenage boy stood next to a river boat, promoting tickets for a river cruise along the Danube. Couples flocked in, most of them tourists, their arms looped together and their eyes bright.</p>

                <p>Feeling content and a little drunk from the cold night air, I bought a ticket and hopped on.</p>

            <div>

                <p>The next day at lunch, he took the seat across from mine, a pot of mint and ginger tea between us.</p>

                <p>“I used to have two assistants.”</p>

                <p>I gave him a blank stare. “You asked me about weird things, right?” he reminded me.</p>

                <p>“Right.”</p>

                <p>“I was cleaning out my flat one night, and I heard knocking at my door. I open it and it’s these two boys, these twins from the same floor. They said they were looking for work in accounting, and asked if I needed any help with the restaurant.”</p>

                <p>I wasn’t sure what kind of story I’d expected to hear from him. “What did you do?”</p>

                <p>“I hired them. Two days a week with a meal included. One would balance the ledger for expenses, the other would balance sales.”</p>

                <p>“I see. Did they get it right most of the time?”</p>

                <p>“Absolutely. Better than I could have done myself. But one day they said something that took me a while to understand. They said ‘once you have looked into the Eye, we’ll have to go.’”</p>

                <p>I stared at him, twiddling my thumbs, not fully disbelieving his story.</p>

                <p>“So what was the eye? Did you see it?”</p>

                <p>“Obviously. Otherwise they’d still be working with me. They said they’d be back when the time was right. I don’t really know what they’ve been up to since then, but I hope they’re doing well.”</p>

                <p>The eye.</p>

                <p>An eye.</p>

                <p>Why did that sound important? I had seen many eyes in my time, but part of me felt an unacknowledged connection there, calling out to be claimed. Before I could probe further, I felt the urgent need to recount something from deep within me.</p>

                <p>“Sometimes I have this dream,” I began.</p>

                <p>“Sometimes you have this dream.”</p>

                <p>“I’m somewhere high above ground—” a gripping sadness, almost sinister, conquered my ability to speak. Feeling the need for a few deep breaths, I slowed and found him observing me, almost expectedly. “I’m sorry,” I whispered.</p>

                <p>He gave a small shake of his head, and poured more tea into my cup.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>The Gellert bathhouse was as majestic on the inside as it was on the outside. In the pearly morning light, it looked like the very definition of majestic itself. I felt soothed just looking at it.</p>

                <p>In the hot waters among the blue walls I thought of the two Astorias, its two sides, one a station and another an eatery, both of them seeming to welcome me back after an absence. Two places, two stories.</p>

                <p>I shifted to the cooler side of the pool and felt my muscles contract. Across from me was a woman laying on the pool steps, holding a thick, crusty old paperback with her one dry hand. She looked as if she would float out of the water at any second and into a distant dream.</p>

                <p>My own dream, always present but never certain, would also give me the illusion of floating. It hadn’t come to me during my trip, but it was simple enough to recount. Though, simple as it was, I couldn’t bring myself to share it with the cook the night before.</p>

                <p>In it, I’d be up in the air, looking down at a brilliant show of lights. Whether they were city lights or stars, I couldn’t be sure. And even though the air was cold on my cheeks, my insides were warm with the knowledge of something down below that was patiently watching, waiting for my descent.</p>

                <p>Over the years it had cultivated in me a sort of longing, and along with it, a longing to know exactly what it was I longed for. The thought of sharing it scared me, as if I were about to show someone something sacred that they would steal for themselves while I slept.</p>

                <p>I should have told him about it.</p>

                <p>It was almost treacherous of me, because I’d come to realize there was something new born within me, a type of warmth, an invasion of my thoughts and a swelling in my chest. Much as I tried, it was hard to ignore, and my impending departure from the city had begun to give me a sense of urgency.</p>

                <p>I turned to float on my back and admire the blue and gold intricacies on the dome of the bathhouse. I closed my eyes, taking in the sounds of hushed conversations among the splashing of water and the rising steam. When I finally got out of the water an hour later, the air felt brand new.</p>

                <p>- Budapest, 1984 -</p>

                <p>In 1984, he came to Budapest with a single mission: perfect a recipe. He couldn’t be too sure of how much time would pass before his recipe met its biggest trial, but in the meantime, there was a new city to explore and a restaurant to open.</p>

                <p>He would rise at 5:00 a.m., walk a mile, eat his breakfast. He told his neighbors he was from the countryside. They never questioned it.</p>

                <p>People liked his burger. So much, in fact, he had to bribe an official at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for an expedited business permit.</p>

                <p>He knew there needed to be a name. An image came to his mind of the Astoria station, a banana yellow trolley dropping off commuters in the heart of the city.</p>

                <p>Hearts and burgers. Burgers and hearts.</p>

                <p>He wrote down “Astoria Burgers of Budapest” on the application.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>He had two assistants, a pair of bespectacled twin brothers. They would come by for two hours on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons to help him balance his ledger and sales. He paid them both 1,000 Forints each day, and sometimes a few extra during busier weeks.</p>

                <p>After closing, he would walk for an hour along the Danube, hands in pockets, a cigarette between his lips, taking in the gilded lights from the Castle and the Parliament.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>In the warm summer months, when he wasn’t at the restaurant or out for his walks, he liked to lie down on his floor and read what he could find.</p>

                <p>It was during one of those sticky nights that he found himself on his balcony, unable to rest and seeking any trace of fresh night air.</p>

                <p>The flat had a nice view of the Buda Castle on the west side of the Danube River. He scanned across the horizon, taking in the sleepy summer streets.</p>

                <p>The humidity called for tea, and he made his way back to the balcony, mug in hand, to return to his evening view.</p>

                <p>And what should he see on the other side of the river, standing cryptically among the housing units like a looming eye, but a giant illuminated wheel?</p>

                <p>The Eye of Budapest.</p>

                <p>But how could this be? A ferris wheel the size and quality of this one weren't built overnight, much less in a matter of seconds. And, unbeknownst to him, the Eye would not open for another nineteen years.</p>

                <p>It dawned on him then what this was, what the twins had informed him of.</p>

                <p>Grabbing his cap, he headed out the door and crossed the Széchenyi Chain Bridge to the city center. It was already late, so he should be careful. The partols would be suspicious of a lone man on the streets after sundown.</p>

                <p>He reached the wheel, the creaking of the gondolas mixing with the songs of crickets. It looked pristine, hypermodern and much sturdier than the ones at the fairs.</p>

                <p>There must have been somewhere between thirty-five to forty gondolas, and all of them were empty—all but the one at the very top. He could make out a lone figure, a lump of shadow, solitary and innocuous.</p>

                <p>Long, slow minutes went by as the wheel inched towards him, and he began to make out the lone figure in the only occupied gondola. It was undoubtedly a person, but there wasn’t much he could tell about them other than the way they stood within the pod, hands on the glass and facing out towards the Danube.</p>

                <p>This must be it, he thought to himself. He wouldn’t see the twins for a while, at least not while this next chain of events was set in motion. He couldn’t be sure of how much time it would take, only that the figure had something to do with it.</p>

                <p>“All is well, comrade?”</p>

                <p>A policeman’s sharp voice cut the silence just as he was about to get a good glimpse at the figure. It was enough to elicit a nod from him and send him on his way back to his flat.</p>

                <p>Once he felt he was safely out of the policeman’s sight, he looked behind his shoulder only to find that the Eye was gone.</p>

                <p>The streets were deserted and the crickets sang. He walked towards the Astoria Station, its entrances blacker than the night.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="fade story-block">
            <div>
                <p>“Are you closing at 11:00 tonight?” I asked him, sipping on tea.</p>

                <p>“I might head out early.”</p>

                <p>And there it was, that something new. Go on, it whispered, and I let the boldness in me produce an invitation.</p>

                <p>“You can come with me, if you want. If you wanna close early. To the Liberty Statue.” A sweat broke out on my palms. I felt silly.</p>

                <p>“I’m not sure that’s a good idea.” He wiped down a few glasses. “The dinner rush is about to start.”</p>

                <p>Part of me wanted to skip the Liberty Statue altogether and stay here—seeing anyone else at Astoria Burgers sounded almost as interesting as getting a scenic view of the city.</p>

                <p>But what would the point be other than to sit and gawk? With only one more day left, I wanted to be sure to visit the statue that always stood so lovingly over the city. The sun would be setting soon, anyway.</p>

                <p>Snuffing out the disappointment that wanted to surface, I thanked him for dinner and headed out.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>Forty minutes after I’d left the restaurant, I was reaching the final flight of stairs leading to the Liberty Statue at the top of Gellért Hill, surrounded by dark green trees that brushed the growing evening breeze along.</p>

                <p>It’d truly been a beautiful hike. A winding dirt path morphed into a steep set of stairs that I wished had no end, each turn gifting me with a view of the sunset casting its soft yellow light on the pastels of the boulevards below.</p>

                <p>I thought of the cook at Astoria Burgers flipping away for the mysterious dinner crowd. I wondered if he even enjoyed hiking—maybe not much, with all his smoking.</p>

                <p>And yet, somehow, there he was when I got to the top.</p>

                <p>He was looking up towards the top of the statue and didn’t seem to notice when I, bewildered, walked to stand next to him.</p>

                <p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

                <p>This time he did look towards me with no delay, though he wasn’t at all surprised to see me.</p>

                <p>“You invited me, didn’t you?”</p>

                <p>I found myself trying to suppress a small smile pushing its way through. “But what about the restaurant? Did you close early? It’s right at the dinner rush.”</p>

                <p>He shrugged, turning his head back to look up at the great Liberty Lady, her back arched towards the sky and her skirt billowing behind her as she held up a palm leaf in both of her hands. We admired her for a few minutes, neither of us saying anything. I wondered what it was like to be her, to believe in a palm leaf so ardently that you were willing to hold it proudly over an entire city. I wondered what my palm leaf was.</p>

                <p>A small conversation began in my head.</p>

                <p>How did this happen? How is it that I’m miles away from home in a place that has nothing to do with me? What is this city? It’s gold all the time. Who is this man? How did I get here? Who brought me here?</p>

                <p>Well, you did. It was your idea. Your credit card.</p>

                <p>You’re right. Did we make the right choice?</p>

                <p>I’m pretty sure we did.</p>

                <p>“Who are you talking to?”</p>

                <p>His knowledge of my thoughts didn’t phase me in the slightest. Inside me, there was a puddle, warm and mixed with a few goosebumps, not just because it was already chilly, but because I didn’t want to admit to myself the real reason I kept going back to his restaurant, the added heaviness I felt in knowing my departure was near.</p>

                <p>But I also wanted to know how in the world he had gotten to the statue.</p>

                <p>“How did you make it up here before I did?”</p>

                <p>“I live here, so I have my ways.”</p>

                <p>I didn’t believe him whatsoever, but felt it was best to leave it at that. After all, the view was much too lovely to worry about the logistics of hiking up a hill.</p>

                <p>A bubble of envy was making its way to the puddle’s surface. “I wish I could stay here, have my own ways.”</p>

                <p>He pulled out his box of cigarettes and lit one. “What’s stopping you?”</p>

                <p>It was a great question, but one that was too possible, too real, to even consider.</p>

                <p>With nothing to say, I continued taking in the sparkling view. I spotted the Dohany Synagogue, and showed him where I thought my flat was. He showed me where he lived, on the Buda side, just a bit behind the Castle. Every day he crossed the Széchenyi Chain Bridge to and from the restaurant.</p>

                <p>My vision strayed to the Eye of Budapest, the city’s resident ferris wheel just a few blocks away from the Danube. Even though I’d walked right by it a few times, I hadn’t noticed just how centered it was, a white little loop balanced in the very core of the city. An eye indeed—I felt it was looking right at me. In fact, I felt like I’d been on it before. Not just seen it, but actually been inside, which I hadn’t done at all during my time in Budapest.</p>

                <p>Something about it was saying “it’s me.” I couldn’t shake away the sense of familiarity, almost feeling a bit too scared of what I might find if I dug too deep.</p>

                <p>I turned to see him looking at me, eyes serious and observant, waiting for me to speak.</p>

                <p>“Sometimes I have this dream,” I started. “I had it not too long ago, before I came here. I’m somewhere high above ground. I think it’s during twilight, because it’s dark and quiet but there’s still a bit of light on the horizon. I look down, and I can tell that something or someone is watching me, waiting for me to come down. I want to get to them, but I’m going down too slowly. And just when I’m about to get close enough to see who or what it is, I wake up.”</p>

                <p>The breeze shuffled his hair. “Sometimes, there’s nothing more that I want in the world than to see what it is that’s waiting.”</p>

                <p>He turned back to look out at the sea of lights, nodding softly. The pain of recounting my dream and my longing receded, ebbing back like a wave on the shore. I reached into my shoulder bag for a coffee candy and offered it to him. He flicked his cigarette into the nearest ashtray and smiled warmly in acceptance. I took one too, relishing in the taste of the coffee and the glimmering lights beneath us.</p>

                <p>That’s what his cigarettes smelled like to me, like a Saturday morning cup of coffee.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>I didn’t want to head back down. Heading back down meant checking off my last stop, and I wasn’t ready for it.</p>

                <p>He was patient, walking with me multiple times around the statue, and visiting the artisan kiosks along the paths.</p>

                <p>“We have to head down at some point,” I conceded after a couple hours, and we descended into the abyss of the trail, turning on our flashlights on our phones to avoid falling.</p>

                <p>A hedgehog waddled by, turning to eyeball us before scurrying off into the shrubbery.</p>

                <p>At the bottom of the steps, we headed toward the closest bridge, the bright green Szabadság Bridge. The Liberty Bridge, it was called in English, though my walking tour guide had been helpful in having us memorize the local names for all of the city’s bridges. This one was my favorite.</p>

                <p>He lived on the Buda side and didn’t need to cross the Danube. Yet he walked with me across the bridge and to the Astoria Station, which was only a block from my flat.</p>

                <p>He turned to me. “I’ll see you tomorrow at lunchtime.”</p>

                <p>I stood there with the light of the Dohany Synagogue, watching his silhouette fade into the yellowness of the city night.</p>

        <section class="fade story-block">
            <div>
                <p>That night after coming back from the Liberty Statue, I didn’t sleep well.</p>

                <p>When I showed up to the restaurant at noon the next day, I still felt the heaviness of a restless night behind my eyes.</p>

                <p>I’d made a choice. I didn’t care anymore about my pension plan or the housing market. My decision was a reckless one, but one that I felt carried a lifetime.</p>

                <p>I found him sweeping his clean floors. “I want you to hire me.”</p>

                <p>He kept on sweeping, and for a second I thought he might’ve not heard me come in. “Aren’t your vacation days almost up?”</p>

                <p>“No. I don’t care about that. I want to be here. Whatever you need for the restaurant, I’ll do it. I’m a fast learner and I want to work with my hands.”</p>

                <p>I want to work here with you.</p>

                <p>A small chuckle. “I didn’t know you were so eager about the restaurant industry. I’m not sure you’d like it, I get the sense you’re not too cut out for hospitality.”</p>

                <p>I was only slightly offended.</p>

                <p>“I’m nice when I have to be. If it’s about money, then I can be your unpaid intern or something. I’ll do whatever you need, I can do website and design stuff, too, if you like.”</p>

                <p>“Isn’t the point of being hired to make money?”</p>

                <p>He was throwing blocks, and I wasn’t sure why. “Then I’ll freelance or teach English on the side.”</p>

                <p>“Well, I’m not hiring at the moment, sorry.”</p>

                <p>I watched as he turned the empty dustpan into the trash. “Why not?”</p>

                <p>Silence.</p>

                <p><em>“Why not?</em> When your big lunch and dinner crowds are here you just manage all by yourself? If you’re not hiring at the moment, then I’ll wait. I mean it. I’m sure you’ll need help at some point.”</p>

                <p>Now he was wiping down his already clean tables, and I had the sudden urge to throw a calculator at his back.</p>

                <p>“I think you might be a bit underqualified.”</p>

                <p>That did it for me.</p>

                <p>“Tell me what this place is, right now. There’s <em>never anyone here</em>. I just want to know. Please. Are you running away from something? If you are, I won’t tell anyone. I just want to help.”</p>

                <p>He stood in place patiently, broom and dustpan in hand. My hands trembled and my ears pounded with gushing blood.</p>

                <p>“Are you done?”</p>

                <p>Not really knowing how to continue my tantrum, I took my usual seat. Hot, angry tears were stubbornly starting to make their way out. Embarrassed, I looked down at my lap, the feeling of his eyes on me strong and painful.</p>

                <p>A few moments passed before he said, gently, “You’re upset and that’s fine. Just sit there and breathe. I’ll make you lunch.”</p>

                <p>I felt like a teenager realizing they were still part child. I was as helpless as I’d been in those days, never having an answer but feeling like there was plenty of time in the world to find it. Except now, my time had run out.</p>

                <p>I heard him from the kitchen, his voice soothing and true.</p>

                <p>“I know you didn’t ask, but this is what I think. You look too hard. I’m sure that your whole life, in everything you’ve ever done, you’ve looked too hard. Not having an answer has never been an option for you.”</p>

                <p>He said this while keeping his eyes on the grilling patties. Absorbing his words, I gathered the courage to say something old and heavy.</p>

                <p>“My whole life, I’ve been told about Forward. The grown-ups would say ‘Always look forward, never back.’ But what if, when you look backwards, you see something worthwhile? What if you find answers there? When you only look forward you can never look around. You can never look around and then, before you know it, ten years have gone by and you didn’t even notice. At home, you can only ever look forward. Time won’t let you do anything differently, it doesn’t let you just be there. That’s why I don’t want to go back.”</p>

                <p>A sizzle as he flipped a patty, and then the clink of his spatula on the counter.</p>

                <p>“What makes you think it’s any different here?”</p>

                <p>“Because here, I could start over.”</p>

                <p><em>Because here, there’d be you.</em></p>

                <p>“There are plenty of problems here, too. You just haven’t seen them yet.”</p>

                <p>Unable to come up with something to say, I turned my attention to the window to look at the passersby. Moments went by with the people on the sidewalks, hand in hand, unaware of my anger. I felt at that moment I would give anything to be one of them, fleeting and unaware.</p>

                <p>“The answer is at the Danube.” He looked up, his expression blank as always. “At the Szabadság Bridge. It’s your favorite, right?”</p>

                <p>I nodded. I’d never told him that.</p>

                <p>“I can also tell you this,” he said. “I’m not a part of your answer.”</p>

                <p>I stayed silent for a while, and then gave him a small smile. “I know.”</p>

                <p>He flipped and sizzled.</p>

                <p>*</p>

                <p>I stood in the middle of the Szabadság bridge for about fifteen minutes, peering into the dark water of the Danube for anything that might stand out. Ferries with tourists drifted by, making it harder to see into the water through the ripples they left behind. The river reflected both sides of the golden city.</p>

                <p>I was stuck in a trench, in a pull between angry and relieved. I brought myself to Budapest to explore and relax, and yet somehow I’d managed to entangle myself in a web of riddles.</p>

                <p>I wanted to be angry with the city, at the cook, at whatever was keeping me from feeling at peace. But I was the one who’d thrown a tantrum at someone who’d shown me nothing but respect. I was the one complicit, the only one who pitied me.</p>

                <p>Would I even be able to understand whatever it was that the Danube needed to show me? There was no point in waiting here if I couldn’t.</p>

                <p>Just as I was about to leave, I saw it. There it was, rising from the water.</p>

                <p>The Answer.</p>

                <p>Brilliant and round as I’d imagined it, no start and no end. Was it indigo, or was it yellow? I couldn’t tell. All I knew for sure was that it was there and I no longer had to look for it.</p>

                <p>Up and up it rose into the brilliant sky of endless stars. I had never seen such a sky among the city lights.</p>

                <p>“Beautiful, isn’t it?” someone behind me asked.</p>

                <p>I closed my eyes and nodded, a tightness in my throat.</p>

                <p>Stay with me, the city said. It reached out to me.</p>

        <section class="fade story-block">
            <div>

                <p>For some reason, I wasn’t surprised when I went to the restaurant the next day and found a line that almost reached the end of the avenue. Customers sat among the same blushed walls and wiry tables and chairs as I had throughout the week, and some even spilled onto a few outdoor tables. But there were a few changes – artwork on the walls, for one. Instead of a twitching clock, a vintage flip card clock sat in front of the register. On the door were additional black letters, adding a “Since 1984” to the restaurant’s name. Beyond the crowd, I saw a row of teenagers flipping patties and assembling burgers.</p>

                <p>And, at the counter, two dark-haired men with glasses managed the registers, identical in their features and mannerisms.</p>

                <p>It should have been too much, but it wasn’t. It was nothing more and nothing less than what I could have expected.</p>

                <p>The romantic in me hoped for a letter or even a small goodbye note scattering through the avenue, reaching its fate by getting caught in my shoe. Deep within me, however, I knew that there would be no trace of him, neither inside nor anywhere in the city.</p>

                <p>I felt confused. Should I have wept? Should I have felt that tugging sensation at the pit of the stomach that comes around at the realization that something has happened? Should I have asked the twins inside if they knew where he was? They must have known. Perhaps it was a remnant of that beautiful, glassy wisp from the Danube, but something in me said this was not a question that needed asking.</p>

                <p>Instead, I hopped on the number 2 trolley, its banana of a cart taking me through the next few years. And though I never saw my friend again, I would sometimes walk by the restaurant and think about those few days we spent together, and the way that the smell of sizzling onions and cigarette smoke seemed to answer a question deep within me that I didn’t know existed, but had tormented me for as long as I could remember.</p>

                <p>After Astoria Burgers left its lease to open in a bigger location in 2023, no other business ever came to occupy the space, and it remained empty up through the very End of Things. I think he would have liked that.</p>

                <p>The cook, the fugitive, the stranger. My friend.</p>

                <p>Whatever his secret was, I was okay with never knowing. Whatever and wherever he was, there would be no easy way of forgetting, but I had the city and I had my time.</p>
                    
                <p>That much, the Answer had given me.</p>
